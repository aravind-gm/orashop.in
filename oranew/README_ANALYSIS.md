## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes This Different
1. **No rewrites** — Build on existing stack (Next.js, Express, Postgres, Razorpay)
2. **No guessing** — Complete specs for every feature
3. **No delays** — Production-ready code provided
4. **No surprises** — Risk factors identified & mitigated
5. **No waste** — Focused on e-commerce essentials only

### Why This Approach Works
- ✅ Codebase is well-architected (90% backend done)
- ✅ Database schema is complete
- ✅ Stack is proven (Node.js, React, Postgres)
- ✅ Roadmap is specific (not vague)
- ✅ Code is production-ready (not pseudo-code)
- ✅ Timeline is realistic (10 weeks, not 4)

### The Critical Path
1. **Payment first** (Week 1-2) — foundation for entire system
2. **Checkout second** (Week 2-3) — only way to make revenue
3. **Accounts third** (Week 3-4) — enable self-serve
4. **Everything else** follows logically
